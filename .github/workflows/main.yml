# Troubleshooting Checklist:
#   - Is the module's manifest file valid JSON?
#     You can test your manifest file using https://jsonlint.com/.
#
#   - Does the module's manifest have all the required keys?
#     See https://foundryvtt.com/article/module-development/#manifest for more
#     information.
#
#   - Are all the proper files and directories being included in the release's
#     module archive ("module.zip")?
#     Check the archiveFiles array in build.ts to see which files are included.
#
#   - Is the release tag the proper format?
#     See the comments for the "Extract Version From Tag" step below.
#
#   - Is a GitHub release being published?
#     This workflow will only run when a release is published, not when a
#     release is updated. Furthermore, note that while a GitHub release will
#     (by default) create a repository tag, a repository tag will not create
#     or publish a GitHub release.
#
#   - Has the module's entry on FoundryVTT's module administration site
#     (https://foundryvtt.com/admin) been updated?

  # A URL that will always point to the latest manifest.
  # FoundryVTT uses this URL to check whether the current module version that
  # is installed is the latest version. This URL should NOT change,
  # otherwise FoundryVTT won't be able to perform this check.

  # Only run this workflow when a release is published.
  # To modify this workflow when other events occur, see:

  # Note that some steps may depend on context variables that are only
  # available for release events, so if you add other events, you may need to
  # alter other parts of this workflow.
